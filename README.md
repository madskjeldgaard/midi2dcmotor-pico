# MIDI 2 DC Motor

This is the code for a Raspberry Pi Pico project featuring two DRV8833 motor driver boards.

It receives MIDI CC over USB and converts that to motor outputs.

## Features

- Platformio-based â€“ easy to compile and upload, gets dependencies automatically
- Has common libraries set up:
  - Bounce2 for debouncing button presses
  - ResponsiveAnalogRead for smoother readings of analog voltages / potentiometers
  - Adafruit MIDI library
  - TINYUSB for USB Midi
- C++17, allowing a lot of modern C++ tricks.
- VSCode tasks are included making building easy in VSCode and in NeoVim (using the Overseer plugin)
- A Github Action which runs every time you push code to test if your firmware still compiles.

## Dependencies

You need to have platformio installed to make use of this.

Install it on MacOS by running homebrew:

```bash
brew install platformio
```

## Compiling and uploading

To compile and upload your sketch, simply run the following command:

```bash
pio run -t upload
```
